I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. I am aiming to pursue a graduate degree in Computer Science in order to contribute to impactful projects in a way that benefits society and the environment, be it through a career in academia as a professor, or as a research scientist at national R&D organizations. 
Research Interests
======
My primary aims for research lie in the field of applications of machine learning, especially projects that have a meaningful impact on society and the environment. In particular, I am interested in interdisciplinary projects related to psychology and social science, healthcare applications, and decision optimization in sports through activity recognition. The opportunities encapsulated by various interdisciplinary laboratories and research centers at prominent research universities in USA influenced my desire to pursue a graduate degree. 
Personal
======
I studied at International Indian School Dammam, one of the largest schools in the world. I was a house captain in the student cabinet during all my years of middle school and high school with the responsibility of leading over 2000 students. I was one of the few students that obtained a perfect CGPA in the national 10th grade CBSE board examinations, thus receiving a certificate of appreciation from the Minister of Education, India. I also obtained a Gold Honour Roll in the national 12th grade CBSE board examinations. I am one of a handful of international students at KFUPM and my admission included a complete tuition waiver, with a monthly stipend from the Ministry of Education of Saudi Arabia, despite being forced to wait a year and attend a community college while waiting for my approval as an expatriate.
My hobbies include playing sports, reading, and video games.
