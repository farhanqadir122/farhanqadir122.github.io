Teaching Assistant Preferences
======
As one of a handful of international undergraduate students at my university, I had to adapt and step out of my comfort zone in order to perform my duties effectively as a TA. This gave me the confidence and ability to successfully communicate with students who had a completely different background and language. This began unofficially during the introductory CS courses, which were taught by my advisor who had just joined the university as well. He had a difficult time adjusting to the abilities of the students who had studied in Arabic all their school life and were taking an undergraduate course for the first time after going through an intensive one year English program. I helped to mitigate some of these issues by communicating with the professor and students, and orgranising weekly student study sessions voluntarily. 

International students were not eligible to hold TA and grader positions at my university. However, following my course performance, my professor strongly recommended my Dean to consider the possibility who in turn obtained approval from student affairs and I was able to work as a grader in the professional ethics course, even grading the midterm exam along with my professor. Because of my good performance and voluntary help sessions, I was appointed as a TA in the first semester of my senior year for the algorithms course. I held weekly office hours and problem sessions(recitations) while grading for over 100 students. In my final semester, I worked as a TA for the Machine Learning course, performing similar tasks as above, while also grading for the Machine Learning course offered to Graduate students.

In addition to this, I have volunteered 100s of verified hours during my high school years at my local preschool, helping the community of international children learn basic English, Arabic, and Math.  I believe that my academic record coupled with my experience serve to highlight my independence, motivation, and proficiency in communication, in two of my non-native languages - English and Arabic, while also being fluent in two other languages - Hindi and Urdu. 


PERSONAL STATEMENT
======

Being an Indian expatriate student, it has always been a challenge to assimilate in Saudi Arabia(KSA) as a non-Arab, especially as an international undergraduate student, despite having lived my entire life here and learned Arabic. Opportunities in every regard have always been extremely limited, primarily based on nationality, not prowess. Yet, I have never let this hold me back as it has been a motivation for me to work even harder. My desire to pursue graduate studies at UIUC is yet another step in this direction to prove my mantle with the core underlying factor being a seminar I attended as a sophomore on cancer detection using deep learning. The endless applications of machine learning for societal and environmental benefits have always captivated me. 

After high school, all my expatriate friends left KSA, as it was impossible to pursue further studies here. But right from my middle school days, I had set my sights on joining KFUPM, one of the best universities in the Arab world. My performance in high school and the national entrance examinations got me accepted to the university, despite the acceptance rate being only 4% even for the citizens. Despite being forced to wait a year for approval from the Ministry of Education, my patience paid off and I was accepted with a full scholarship and monthly stipend. In high school, I was the national junior badminton champion multiple times, also representing Saudi Arabia in the CBSE national badminton championships held in India. But I had to forgo this passion after high school, with every public badminton competition being restricted to Saudi nationals only and no inter-university competitions. But considering my familyâ€™s financial status, with a sole earner and two college-going siblings, I could not give up this golden opportunity. 

After my sophomore year, I found that internships were tremendously hard to come by despite having a perfect major GPA, extensive side projects, and successful interviews. The most challenging interview experience was with a globally renowned company that accepted me after multiple rounds, but I was then rejected by the HR department after stating my nationality. I kept trying for months and finally found a company, AMT Arabia, that was looking for an intern to work on their ongoing CRM web project. After my junior year, I was selected by the Research Institute at KFUPM, where I got an opportunity to select between an emotion detection project and a greenhouse gas emissions project. I sought the latter to create awareness, at least in the university community towards climate change and the importance of clean energy because of my observations. Having noticed innumerable laborers and others toiling hard in extreme temperatures, while also being someone who spent a lot of time unknowingly yet carelessly contributing to these emissions, I wanted to play a small part in bringing this to the attention of other similar individuals, as it is a common practice here. An extremely pleasant and satisfactory moment was when the Vice President of the university praised my project and encouraged the community to consider the harmful effects of these emissions. I have spent hundreds of verified hours volunteering to help these individuals by donating and distributing food and teaching them basic English and Arabic. 

As stated in my updated research interests, my aim is to work towards raising awareness for various issues in the Middle East, especially related to matters that have been recognized in the world, but not here. I have longed to be a part of a community where diversity and inclusion are the norm, and this will enforce my innate desire to contribute to the same in a place where I will not be prevented from doing so.


Research Interests
======
My primary aims for research lie in the field of applications of machine learning, especially projects that have a meaningful impact on society and the environment. In particular, I am interested in interdisciplinary projects related to psychology and social science, healthcare applications, and decision optimization in sports through activity recognition. The opportunities encapsulated by various interdisciplinary laboratories and research centers at prominent research universities in USA influenced my desire to pursue a graduate degree. 

Personal
======
I studied at International Indian School Dammam, one of the largest schools in the world. I was a house captain in the student cabinet during all my years of middle school and high school with the responsibility of leading over 2000 students. I was one of the few students that obtained a perfect CGPA in the national 10th grade CBSE board examinations, thus receiving a certificate of appreciation from the Minister of Education, India. I also obtained a Gold Honour Roll in the national 12th grade CBSE board examinations. I am one of a handful of international students at KFUPM and my admission included a complete tuition waiver, with a monthly stipend from the Ministry of Education of Saudi Arabia, despite being forced to wait a year and attend a community college while waiting for my approval as an expatriate.

My hobbies include playing sports, reading, and video games.


Badminton
------
I have represented Saudi Arabia at various age levels in school and won several accolades. Due to circumstances out of my control, I had to stop playing competitively as the scholarship offered by KFUPM was a golden opportunity to relieve the financial burden on my family. Unfortunately, there are no inter-university competitions in Saudi Arabia and all other public competitions are restricted to Saudi citizens only.
